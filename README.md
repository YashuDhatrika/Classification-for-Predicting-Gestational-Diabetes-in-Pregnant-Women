# Classification-for-Predicting-Gestational-Diabetes-in-Pregnant-Women

Objective: Prediction of Gestational Diabetes in Pregnant Women
Context: Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that is first seen in a pregnant woman who did not have diabetes before she was pregnant. Some women have more than one pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually shows up in the middle of pregnancy. Doctors most often test for it between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.  
Tools /Concepts: Python, Expectation–maximization algorithm and multiclass logistic regression. 
Data: Captures the metrics like weight, height, physical activity, blood pressure, ethnicity, food intake (vitamins, calcium, carbohydrate.) and other biological attributes like RBC count, etc. Model Implementation:
• Developed a baseline model (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and a mixture of an expert model (probabilistic model) to predict gestational diabetes in pregnant women.
 • Improved accuracy from 72% to 93% by adopting the mixture of an expert model over other baseline models.

Key findings:
1.  Race and Ethnicity have been differentiating factor to identify if the women are probable to get gestational diabetes or not.
2.  Prior history of gestational diabetes was also an important factor. People having prior gestational diabetes are probable to develop diabetes this time.

3. The other differentiating factors were food intake (carbohydrate), hypertension, and physical activity
